# encryptor
An application that encrypts and decodes text using any number of cryptographic algorithms.</br></br>

This application is intended to demonstrate an understanding of the included cryptographic algorithms.</br></br>

User simply pastes their plaintext into the appropriate form field, selects the encryption algorithm of their choice from the drop down menu, and depending on the algorithm, chooses a key.</br></br>

The application can either produce encrypted text to be copied and pasted, or a text file can be produced if the user wishes it.</br></br>

The file system uses a rudimentary MVC format where the form serves as view, the Controller communicates between the View and the selected encrytion program that produces the Model.
